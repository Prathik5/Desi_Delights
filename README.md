- `Shimmer Page` : This website uses a shimmer effect to show placeholders while the data is loading. This improves the user experience and reduces bounce rate.
- `Redux Toolkit` : This website uses Redux Toolkit to manage the cart state and actions. Redux Toolkit simplifies the Redux code and reduces boilerplate.
- `Code Splitting` : This website uses code splitting to divide the code into smaller chunks that are loaded on demand. This improves the performance and reduces the initial loading time.
- `Jest` : This website uses Jest as the testing framework to write unit tests for the components and functions. Jest is a popular and easy-to-use testing library for React.
- `Tailwind CSS` : This website uses Tailwind CSS as the styling framework to create responsive and elegant designs. Tailwind CSS provides utility classes that make styling easy and fast.
- `Babel` : This website uses Babel as the transpiler to transform modern JavaScript code into compatible versions for older browsers. Babel ensures that the website works across all browsers without any issues.
-  `CORS` : This website uses CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to enable communication between the frontend and the backend servers. CORS allows requests from different origins to access resources on another origin.
